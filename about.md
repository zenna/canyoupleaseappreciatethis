A space for five minute contemplation.

THE RULES:
Only read a post when you have space to contemplate it for five minutes. 

IF YOU BREAK THE RULES:

Be aware that breaking these rules is very serious, that you are completely forgiven, and that you are allowed to start again.

IF YOU WANT SOMETHING APPRECIATED HERE:
You know how to reach me.
