A space for five minute contemplation.

#THE RULES: 

Only read a post when you have space to contemplate it for five minutes. 

#IF YOU BREAK THE RULES:

If a post was read and was not contemplated for five minutes, then it was not read as intended.

Be aware that breaking these rules is very serious, that you are completely forgiven, and that you are allowed to start again.

You are allowed to start again even if you did not break the rules.  Starting again is both encouraged and discouraged, so it's up to you. 

#IF YOU WANT SOMETHING APPRECIATED HERE:

You know how to reach me.
