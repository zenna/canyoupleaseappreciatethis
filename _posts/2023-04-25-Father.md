Fearfully, watching over him

My mum, carer and me.

His breathing slowed down.

With the occasional gasp

For air

Peacefully and quietly

He slipped away.

Into the realms of The Father

He faithfully believed in.

How fortunate we have been

To share in the passing

Of a Life

The father of my brothers and me.
