After dark, the park becomes dangerous.

I stayed in the park after dark, finished the Sapporo Zenna had slipped into my basket at HMart, crossed paths with rats.  I was surprised by the many kids streaming in as I left. 

Appreciate the night like Joe taught me -- high contrast shaddows, and a calm that has room for vigilance. 

Appreciate the threshold of darkness.
