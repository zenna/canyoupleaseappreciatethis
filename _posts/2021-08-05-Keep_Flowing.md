I recognized I was in a flow state when the honey seller at the farmers market told me "Keep flowing". Other strangers noticed too. The neighbor on the roof with 30 minutes of mouth watering details about his favorite places in the city. The dancer on the street when we waved and smiled at each other in unison. And the other walker who saw this and smiled.  Abdi at the smoothie place who asked me, several times amid the blenders, if I had lived on a farm. The skateboarder arcing a tight right from 125th street onto Broadway -- I don't remember the moment we shared so much as the knowing delight as we laughed and waved goodbye.  I don't understand these fairy-land connections, which can be scary. But I appreciate the river I'm flowing in and won't hide from it.
