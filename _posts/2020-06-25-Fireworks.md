I didn't appreciate the now-constant fireworks until you asked me to appreciate something.  I could almost smell the close few whose wet sounding sparkles brought back memories of reciting the Declaration of Independence. 

I haven't been able to stay awake enough to articulate what I appreciate. 

But I dreamt of a little parasitic snake again, this time burrowing in my finger, and I realize prying and squeezing it out won't work, since broken pieces of it regenerate.  Next time, I will treat it like the mythological creature that it is.  I will patiently hum a song to coax it out.  Once it is completely out, I will pounce and pin its head down and beat it until it sheds its skin and turns into a beautiful maiden. Then I will burn the skin before interacting with the maiden. I am eager to see the snake again, but will be patient.
