Yesterday morning, the bottles of hand sanitizer by the entrance to my Institute had been replaced by wall-mounted dispensers.  Can I tell you everything else that changed recently?  Of course not!  I'd prefer we don't focus on the changes right now. 

I recorded data from Emerald 2, a bird I've been working with for many months, and it looks like I'm on the verge of replicating my observation of what memory recall looks like in the brain.  At Fairway Market, the man behind me in line bought one large bubbly water bottle, two large Dr. Bronner's soap containers, and nothing else.  I bought more than he did, and when I got home, made an online donation to a food pantry down the street. Today, I had to euthanize my first experimental bird since my grandmother's death, Chocolate 7, and wasn't inclined to look away or distract myself, contemplating, among other things, that my grandmother asked to donate her body to science. During my "evening bird duty" shift, giving birds fresh food and water, I appreciated our systematic cleaning routines.  When I got home, I prepared a typically-hodgepodge mix of foods for dinner, with some help from my Panasonic FlashXpress toaster oven, which my grandmother had given me, at the recommendation of Sister Claire. Over the course of the day, I got some fun pi day texts.
