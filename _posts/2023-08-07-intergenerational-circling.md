I knew that hiking with my mother
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would be beautiful, 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again. 
Appreciate that it was. 
My almost flooded socks and sandles, 
Her injured tendon and hiking poles, 
Intergenerational craft circles, 
As legit as it gets, 
Inspiring each other, 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imperfectly. 
I turned away to let tears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flow in the mossy forest -- 
Fullness, satisfaction. 
Until it could be better. 
The world could be better. 
We could be better. 
Appreciate the 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fullness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of not enough.
