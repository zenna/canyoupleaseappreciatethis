We're in a heat wave. I feel a phantom tightness in my ears, and a cold clammy sweat that I might blame on the air conditioner. 

I was tired today, thoughts hazy, distant.  People were kind to me though. 

The peach was good and juicy. It hadn't felt quite ripe to me at the market, and I would have put it back if I hadn't fondled it so much.  It dripped all the way down to my elbow twice. 

I didn't want to peel all the little garlic cloves.  So I cut the root ends off the cloves and what remained of the head and put them in the toaster oven.  I'm proud and excited by how they roasted into a delicious and fun-to-peel snack.  I might go lower and slower next time to make it sweeter.
