I've been working on designing a bird backpack for a couple weeks now.  It has two parts that connect with a magnet. They need to be easy to connect, but also tight enough not to rattle. 1/128th of an inch matters. I 3D printed two options overnight last night and the tighter one is just right. I often get fed up with working out the details before I'm totally done with an idea. So I'm proud I iterated the backpack as much as I did, measuring the curvature of the bird's back, and designing a jig to precisely set the strap lengths.
