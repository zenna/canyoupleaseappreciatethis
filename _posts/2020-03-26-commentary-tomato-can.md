A commentary on "Tomato Can" was delivered today by USPS. The commentary includes several objects: a can opener and a paring knife.  It also includes several entities that can be described by mass/non-count nouns: rice (from Arson Mills, whose grits I remember fondly), alphabet pasta (with the whole alphabet (!) not just ABC123 like the last batch I saw), and beans (now that I think of it, beans is actually plural, not a mass noun).  The two remaining entities have handwritten text on them, which I will reproduce for you here.  

...

Dear Emily, 

Here's hoping you <u>appreciate</u> these objects, their essence, their utility, their form and function.  

Consider contemplating them, without a commitment to do so, for five minutes. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.

Consider what it means to be designed to open a can or pare a piece of fruit before and after having been used to do so. 

Consider, too, the story of the tulip quilt. 

Consider having versus creating vs. realizing potential. 

Love, Mummy xo
