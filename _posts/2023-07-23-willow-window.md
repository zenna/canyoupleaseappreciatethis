Willow tree, shading me again,  
Your leaf on my lap, yellow sliver,  
Opening to the world of pulsing texture.  
Why so narrow, willow leaf window?  
\
\
Who understands the question?  
Your window is so wide you're outside,  
Willow weeping yellow leaves.  
Who else, like me, wills windows wider?  
\
\
I wondered yesterday why you weren't wider,  
It's been three decades, today  
I notice your heavy limbs trimmed back  
. . . space . . .  
\
\
I fill space more than make space.  
Fear, habit, fear, habit.  
I make space.  
We make almost anything.
