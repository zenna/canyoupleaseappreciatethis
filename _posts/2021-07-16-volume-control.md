A side effect of the pandemic for me is that listening to music has become very emotionally intense.  I've been avoiding it.  But I turned on some music on my nice speaker now, and I appreciate the wet vibrations. You're listening to my music these 5 minutes. Your ears might feel ticklish straining to hear in the silence. If it gets too loud, it's ok to put in your earplugs and dance, feeling the bass deep in your bones.
