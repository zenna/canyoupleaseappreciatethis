I'm engaged! Thank you for forgiving that I lapsed on my intention to write you something every day for 30 days, even if you don't 100% forgive me. I proposed to Joseph under the milky way and shooting stars, then he proposed to me, and now I have Granny's unique ring to wear, and everyone sees me slightly differently. I'd started therapy, made major realizations. Before we make more assumptions, I've now stepped back from therapy, with a diagnosis of "within the range of normal". Good feelings are challenging to describe. In an effort to reassure you I do not intend to contract like we sometimes see engaged mentally healthy people do, I have a strong urge to tell you I'm feeling EXPANSIVE.  But actually I'm feeling BALANCED. The trail I'm on has a good enough view to give me vertigo, but it's wide enough that I don't need to flail my arms or urge one of you to step away from the edge. I'm glad you're here.
