Right around the time I had decided to be a neuroscientist, but hadn't admitted it to myself, I heard a lecture by Murray Sherman that left a strong impression.  I appreciated the irreverent comparison between the shape of the Thalamus and the shape Michelangelo had painted God sitting on in the Sistine Chapel as He reached both out to Adam in Cortex, and (with the other hand, usually ignored) back to deeper output structures; the clarity of the Interactive conceptual model; and behind it all the decades of detailed anatomical work Sherman had done with his friend Ray Guillery.  

Once I had done enough neuroscience to be frustrated by discussions of Consciousness, I was approached through a friend (Deniz) by Ray Guillery, who was struggling with the final chapters of his final book, where he had hoped to get insights into Consciousness by relating the Interactive view of brain signals to engineering ideas about an information system becoming its own programmer.  I had some interesting exchanges with Ray, but often failed to respond well or promptly, which has left me with a heavy feeling. 

Ray died in 2017, and his book, The Brain as a Tool, was published posthumously.  I am listed in the acknowledgements as someone "involved in the preparation of this book in one of many different ways", which strikes me as incredibly generous. I am currently reading the book, which is great and contains some detailed and surprising  connections to my current work.  I do not know how or when I will engage with the final chapters, so am writing this now.
