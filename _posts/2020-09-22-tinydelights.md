I wasn't sure what I was saving this "I AM GRATEFUL FOR TINY DELIGHTS" sticker for, but something about the intricate almost magical design made me want to hold on to it.  I chose a different one of Janine's Kwohtations stickers to include with the letter I was writing. 

Being in the forest violates my standard "going to the bathroom" ritual, exposing deep fears (What if I am Seen?  What if I get Dirty?) as well as joys (I Feel Great! I am so Proud of that Accomplishment!). 

I am bringing my mother backpacking for the first time this weekend. Among the shared gear she checked several times that I would bring was a light-weight shovel for digging a hole to poop in.  

Joseph saw me carefully pick out a suitable bag (green and shimmery) to hold my new shovel, and suggested adding stickers: 

 

MY VALUE IS NOT 
DETERMINED BY MY 
PRODUCTIVITY

 

I AM 
<u>NOT</u> 
A BURDEN

 

I CAN DO THIS*
*AND IF I CAN'T IT WILL 
PROBABLY BE OKAY ANYWAYS

 

I AM 
GRATEFUL 
FOR TINY 
DELIGHTS
