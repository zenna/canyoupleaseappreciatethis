Several years ago, I took a very hot bath. So hot I was sweating and my heart was pounding. I took a deep breath in, and was surprised to feel several rapid unplanned breaths. I experimented a bit, and discovered these bizarre little breaths were generated by the pulsing of my heart displacing air in and out of my lungs. Looking back, I realize this was a rare example of me observing my breath without immediately influencing it. Today, I'm pretty sure that, uninfluenced, my breath slowly cycles between shallow and deep about every ten breaths.Â  But it's hard to keep track, since I get distracted thinking of how to describe it to you. I forgive you for influencing my breath: I also can't help but influence yours.
