Some fabric is knit and some is woven. Woven threads are straighter, and knit threads twist in little loops, making the fabric stretchy. This fleece blanket is so plush I can't see the threads. But these two fleece pieces are more worn, and I was able to separate the fuzz and determine that they are both knit.  The threadbare parts of my stuffed animal platypus are also knit. I did this investigation specially for you.
