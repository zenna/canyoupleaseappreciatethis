I have been wanting to write, but waiting for something with enough energy behind it. 

I've been noticing some slight pressure in my ears when I'm in a particular emotional state.  What else defines this state besides the warm ear pressure? Fear? Alertness? Shame? Or perhaps I've been feeling weather pressure!

I'm sitting in my bathroom, my only windowless room. I didn't go downstairs as the tornado warning instructed, or even close the bathroom door.

As I return to my hammock, the eerie silence is replaced by the familiarity of distant sirens, and cars rolling by.  Familiarity? No. I'm still alert enough to hear which direction each car is coming from.  Long pauses between cars tell me others are too.
