Alexandra's friend was teaching floor barre movement class.  Did I want to try it? Yes, sounds fun, I said, not quite feeling it.  But appreciate how wonderful it was, cathartic tears replacing sweat in the end as she taught us to let our bodies feel "Wow".  "WOooOoOw" in her french accent. opening from my lower back, joyful wonder washing over me.  Appreciate that I let the "Wow" feeling in, with its tears, only slightly holding them back, because I trusted Alexandra and her teacher friend would understand.
