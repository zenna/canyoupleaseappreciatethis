Incessant thoughts of change,  
The windswept precipice,  
Is not a place for rest.  
Love fragile rugged vertigo,  
&nbsp; Appreciate rest.  
\ 
\ 
Is rest the radical change,  
I'm seeking? Yes and also No.  
Appreciate my Saturday, 9:45am  
Barbie movie alone,  
&nbsp; train to Rockaway,  
\ 
\ 
Sleeping and reading in the hot sand,  
Umbrella, towel, cool drinks, clementine,  
Radically rested, Appreciate  
Sunday, sweet Joe morning,  
&nbsp; Joyfully coding up  
\ 
\ 
Yellow Herbert to recite my poetry,  
Until cello quintet, such joy,  
Enough energy to cook and clean.   
Appreciate this is still  
&nbsp; not everything.
