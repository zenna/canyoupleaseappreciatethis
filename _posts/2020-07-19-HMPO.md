I’ve got my brand-new replacement passport.  It’s only three weeks since I sent in the old one by post to HMPO (Her Majesty’s Passport Office) anticipating a long delay because of the Coronavirus Lockdown.  HMPO’s guidance was not encouraging … "Do not apply unless… "

The colour of this new British Passport is very dark blue which replaces the burgundy European one now that the UK has BREXIT.  I must be amongst the first group of people receiving this, almost black, passport but I’m not excited.  Instead, I’m reminded of  ‘Colonialism’ which is supposed to be ‘Historical’ but which, like Racism, still exists and is not just about colour.            

Being pragmatic, a  passport is essentially a travel document. It was nearing its expiry date and I need to travel soon to get home. But where’s home?  Home is where your heart is, as the saying goes.  So, there is no doubt.

The COVID-19 pandemic means that there are no flights to where I want to go.  But I can visualise where I want to be, with or without a passport.
