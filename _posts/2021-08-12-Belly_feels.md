I'm feeling a pleasant subtle tingling ASMR listening to the bubbles in my bubbly water glass.  Unsatisfied choosing any particular appreciatiable topic from today, I give myself permission to spend less time choosing, and accept what's in front of mee -- sunflowers starting to shrivel, greasy pizza box supporting dried holograms, my purple plant that is still flowering, not literally right now but budding for the morning.  Oh, and the surprisingly permeating good will arising from my practice of remembering to feel how my belly feels.
