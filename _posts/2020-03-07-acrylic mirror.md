I left a chocolate on my friend Hannah's desk.  She left me an origami crane folded from the wrapper.  One day, Hannah was wearing earings made from mirrored acrylic.  I needed to see around corners in my experiment, so I was inspired to order a sample acrylic mirror to test in the laser cutter. I placed the scrap mirror behind the origami crane on my desk, so I could see two birds.  A few days later, Hannah was recording brain waves in a sleeping bird, using a night vision camera to see when the bird's eyes were closed.  As the bird tossed and turned, her camera would lose sight of the bird's eyes. Hannah asked to borrow my acrylic mirror scrap, and can now see the bird's eyes almost all the time.  The exception is if the bird happens to sleep with their head under their wing.  For the last couple days, our labmates have been gathering around Hannah's desk to see her adorable high-resolution sleeping bird and the bursts of activity she's recording from their brain.
