Do you remember what it feels like  
&nbsp; to have decided but not officially decided?  
Someone may have heard your decision,  
&nbsp; before you admitted it to yourself.  
Some colleagues may still not hear it.  
&nbsp; After you've been clear enough,  
Often enough, they still ask why,  
&nbsp; or disagree. You've been patient,  
Listened for hours, weeks, months.  
You still respect and cherish those  
&nbsp; Who still don't hear you.  
But now you've officially decided,  
&nbsp; It's easier to communicate your decision.  
The tingling pressure of waiting  
&nbsp; For everyone to understand and agree  
Pops. Ouch. Relief.

Appreciate that Gily recognized this feeling in me today, over Whatsapp on the roof.

\
Appreciate that I recognized this feeling in Zenna today, as I listened, happily interrupting less than I might have.  
\
\
Appreciate that when I asked Zenna to close our conversation with a recitation by Yellow Herbert, Herbert randomly chose Decisions by Lullyn Tavares.  
\
\
Appreciate Zenna's 'Thanks Mum!'
