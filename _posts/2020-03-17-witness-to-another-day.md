Another Day
<ul> &bull; to find the Florida birds so close to home ... the red cardinal in the palm tree ... the blue heron in the reeds, a statue watching the alligator pass by ... the whistling ducks like soldiers waiting for more troops to arrive, a diving cormorant.</ul> 

<ul> to savor the tasty morsels navigating twisty passages of a healing colon</ul> 

<ul> to find and place jigsaw pieces in difficult and familiar puzzles</ul> 

<ul> to laugh and delight in voices and hugs just when they are needed</ul> 

<ul> to be scared of the pains and discomforts of aging and illness</ul> 

<ul> to read and listen to the wisdom and the nonsense of humanity</ul> 

<ul> to go up and down like ocean swells</ul> 

<ul> to be silly, to celebrate, to bring joy</ul> 

<ul> to select outfits and jewelry</ul> 

<ul> to remember birthdays and worry and cheer about the little things</ul> 

<ul> to feel breezes and raindrops</ul> 

<ul> to solve crossword puzzles and lift weights.</ul> 

<ul> to decorate a room, a gift, a smile</ul> 

<ul> to see the moon in the night sky and the sunâ€™s morning rise.</ul> 

These, these are your days, witnessed!
