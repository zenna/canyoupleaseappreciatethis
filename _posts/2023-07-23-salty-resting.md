Eating flaky sea salt straight from the bag . . .  
I got rid of my purple plant, kept only a cutting,  
Appreciate each hair on its leaves,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for what?  
\
\
I cling to this dusty sun lit leaf hair, this moment,  
To escape the racing turbulence of possible  
moments,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; planning, cleaning, doing, sharing, waiting, checking, . . .  
\
\
I appreciate more leaf hairs, taste more salt,  
Because you agreed to appreciate this, so  
Thanks for carrying me,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as I rest here.  
\
\
I wish I shared every leaf hair, and since I canâ€™t,  
I wish unshared appreciations could taste like shared ones.  
Do you also fear the turbulence  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that marks the end of   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a moment  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a poem  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appreciation ?
