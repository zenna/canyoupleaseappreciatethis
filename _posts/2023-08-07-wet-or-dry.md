I don't cling to memory.  
I sacrefice memory for rest,  
And for courageous action.  
My posture, note quite Eve,  
A different Age.  
Textures inevitably change,  
Carving a riverbed, memory,  
Now dry, preserved.  
I disconnect.  
Who is the mentor?  
What kind of teacher,  
Is a riverbed?  
Never wet or dry!
