Sister Claire has gotten really good at communicating this year. 

I appreciated this when I had a fullblown fit of tears and quarantine panic flashbacks during our discussion of what precautions to take before meeting up. 

When I hurt her with things I shouldn't have said, and made her cry, she lashed back enough for me to see her pain, then gracefully recovered in front of my eyes. 

When I felt unheard, she listened, even through my long pauses, and affirmed what I needed affirmed. 

When I failed to listen, trapped in eddies of thoughts and emotions, she patiently repeated things. 

Appreciate all this and more. Appreciate that I should sleep now.
