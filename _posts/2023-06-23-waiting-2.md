The butterfly didn't fly away,  
Yet. Nor did the flower deflate,  
Its swollen urn-shaped base, behind  
The delicate flat white petals.  

Are they waiting, like me, for some  
Other future moment? Of course they are!  
But their moment, copulation, lets them  
Wilt, wither, die, then crumble or decay.  

They might never copulate, and wither  
Anyway. No shame blocks their beauty,  
Flowing, intricate, trembling, into the world,  
Swelling and collapsing with waves of life and death.  

The butterfly is waiting, wholeheartedly  
For something its nervous system  
Can't imagine, will barely survive.  
This butterfly, waiting  
  Is what not waiting looks like.
