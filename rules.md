<h5>The Rules:</h5>

This is a space for five minute contemplations. Only read a post if and when you have space to contemplate it for five minutes. 

<h5>If you break the Rules:</h5>

If a post was read and was not contemplated for five minutes, then it was not read as intended. That includes this rules post.  You clicked a button to get here. I made the button, which means it is special to me, and I made the rules, which means they are also special to me. Be aware that breaking these rules is very serious. However, if you have broken the rules, you are completely forgiven, and allowed to start again. You are allowed to start again even if you did not break the rules, or if you are not sure whether or not you broke the rules. Starting again is both encouraged and discouraged, so it depends what feels right to you in the moment. Know that every post is subject to change, and that includes this rules post. The only way to know for sure what a post currently says is to commit to contemplate it for five minutes.  

<h5>Hints:</h5> 

I recommend that you start each contemplation by taking a deep breath, then reading the text.  There is no rush, since you will have time to spare after you finish reading. After you finish reading, contemplate.  You may close your eyes if you want.  If you sense you are no longer contemplating, I recommend you take note of what you are doing instead (it might be interesting), then take another deep breath, look at the text, re-read as much as you want, then continue contemplating. You do not need to check the time, since the website will thank you five minutes after you pressed the button. Any thanks you receive from the website will be genuine, regardless of which directions your contemplation went. 

If any part this experience is difficult, know that I am thinking of you, and that I'm pretty sure your experience will become more interesting than it is difficult.  To prove this to you, I rounded the corners of the button so that you wouldn't scratch yourself on the sharp corners.  

<h5>If you need more rules:</h5> 

Contemplate the issue about which you think you need additional rules, and I expect they will come.  For example, I thought I needed a rule about comments on this website, and contemplation gave me the rule that all comments must be delivered by USPS. I liked this rule, but lacked space to add it officially. With unofficial rules, proceed at your own risk.
