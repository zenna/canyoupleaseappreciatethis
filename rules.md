<h5>The Rules:</h5>

This is a space for five minute contemplations. Only read a post if and when you have space to contemplate it for five minutes. 

<h5>If you break the Rules:</h5>

If a post was read and was not contemplated for five minutes, then it was not read as intended. That includes this rules post.  You clicked a button to get here. I made the button, which means it is special to me, and I made the rules, which means they are also special to me. Be aware that breaking these rules is very serious.   However, if you have broken the rules, you are completely forgiven, and allowed to start again. You are allowed to start again even if you did not break the rules, or if you are not sure whether or not you broke the rules.  Starting again is both encouraged and discouraged, so it's up to you. 

<h5>If you want something appreciated here:</h5>

You know how to reach me.
