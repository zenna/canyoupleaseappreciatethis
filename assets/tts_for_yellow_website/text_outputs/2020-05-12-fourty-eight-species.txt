Fourty-eight Species, by Emily Mackevicius, May 12, 2020: Despite studying particular birds in lab for almost 10 years, I hadn't learned to identify birds in the wild. In the 11 days since getting my monocular, I have identified 48 different species of birdsÂ in the park. I'm excited to keep practicing identifying birds. It is improving my vision.
