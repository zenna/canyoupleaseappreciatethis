Shards of Glass, by Emily Mackevicius, August 09, 2021: I broke the glass vase transferring my sunflowers to the mermaid pottery vase I made with Dyuti.  Cleaning up the sparkly shards, I remember a dream I had as a child of throwing beach glass over a cliff, only to realize it would shatter into dust and float up to blind us. Checking myself for damage, and finding a shallow red slash on my palm, I remember "Pizza", the festival performance artist who stomped on broken glass, then stripped off her pizza costume to erotically bask in it. Watching the next act from the bench, her thigh bled onto her pizza costume. Before breaking the vase, I considered writing about how I revisited flow state a few times today, and focusing on the fascinating border as I flicker in and out. Staring at the mermaid vase, I recognize the same mesmerizing turbulance I like to chase in the drippy swirly mixes between glaze types.
