Father, by Lullyn Tavares, April 25, 2023: Fearfully, watching over him      My mum, carer and me.      His breathing slowed down.      With the occasional gasp      For air      Peacefully and quietly      He slipped away.      Into the realms of The Father      He faithfully believed in.      How fortunate we have been      To share in the passing      Of a Life      The father of my brothers and me.
