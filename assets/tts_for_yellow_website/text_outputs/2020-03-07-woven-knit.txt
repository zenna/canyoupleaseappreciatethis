Woven or Knit, by Emily Mackevicius, March 07, 2020: Some fabric is knit and some is woven. Woven threads are straighter, and knit threads twist in little loops, making the fabric stretchy. This fleece blanket is so plush I can't see the threads. But these two fleece pieces are more worn, and I was able to separate the fuzz and determine that they are both knit.  The threadbare parts of my stuffed animal platypus are also knit, and each fuzz fiber is about two inches long. I did this investigation specially for you.
