Craft Night, by Emily Mackevicius, August 10, 2021: Craft night started outside on the roof, chased inside by a dark gray thunder cloud.  Making a cardboard model house inside a glass house. Old holograms shattered as new ones developed. Beads made their way into needlework, chains into holograms.  Weaving phrases into each others' stories.  Ending on the couch, the hammock, the increasing mentions of next time.
