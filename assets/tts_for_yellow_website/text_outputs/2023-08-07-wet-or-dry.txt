Wet or Dry, by Emily Mackevicius, August 07, 2023: I don't cling to memory.     I sacrefice memory for rest,     And for courageous action.     My posture, note quite Eve,     A different Age.     Textures inevitably change,     Carving a riverbed, memory,     Now dry, preserved.     I disconnect.     Who is the mentor?     What kind of teacher,     Is a riverbed?     Never wet or dry!
