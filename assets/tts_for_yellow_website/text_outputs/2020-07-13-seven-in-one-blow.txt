Seven in One Blow, by Emily Mackevicius, July 13, 2020: The Grimm Brothers' "Brave Little Tailor" fairy tale starts with the Tailor killing seven flies in one blow.  He is so inspired that he makes himself a "Seven in One Blow" belt, and sets off into the world.  He defeats a giant, who is intimidated by his belt, then continues on a life of wonderful adventures.       I remembered the Brave Little Tailor because I just caught a fly in a paper cup and released it out my window!      I had seen it circling my apartment during my zoom meeting. It was big, a house fly not a fruit fly.  It easily dodged my flailing coaster.  Its reflexes outmatched my ability to slam the cup down quickly.       So instead I moved as slow as I was able and it worked... I shook the cup and heard the fly inside!       I was so pleased and eager for you to appreciate my triumph. As the new owner of a belt-sized loom, I now appreciate the Brave Little Tailor for his weaving inspiration.
