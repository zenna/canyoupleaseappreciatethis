Witness to Another Day ..., by Anne-Marie Lambert, March 17, 2020: Another Day           to find the Florida birds so close to home ... the red cardinal in the palm tree ... the blue heron in the reeds, a statue watching the alligator pass by ... the whistling ducks like soldiers waiting for more troops to arrive, a diving cormorant.                  to savor the tasty morsels navigating twisty passages of a healing colon                  to find and place jigsaw pieces in difficult and familiar puzzles                  to laugh and delight in voices and hugs just when they are needed                  to be scared of the pains and discomforts of aging and illness                  to read and listen to the wisdom and the nonsense of humanity                  to go up and down like ocean swells                  to be silly, to celebrate, to bring joy                  to select outfits and jewelry                  to remember birthdays and worry and cheer about the little things                  to feel breezes and raindrops                  to solve crossword puzzles and lift weights.                  to decorate a room, a gift, a smile                  to see the moon in the night sky and the sunâ€™s morning rise.       These, these are your days, witnessed!      love, love, love, Awie xo
