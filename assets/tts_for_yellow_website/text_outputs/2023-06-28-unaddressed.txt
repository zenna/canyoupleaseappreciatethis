Unaddressed, by Emily Mackevicius, June 28, 2023: Unaddressed letter to my mentors                 Sinking back into music,     Dancing alone, so you won't     Smile or stare without joining me,     Won't block my view of other dancers,     Won't let me believe     I'm dancing alone.                 I might shut my eyes,     Find a quiet cave or cliff.     It won't be quiet there,     Even underwater, something     will be dancing. We teach     Each other how     to not dance.                 How to clip our birds' wings,     How to construct the boxes,     We trap each other in.     How to stay still, watching     Others dance, and also,     How to dance.                 Will you let me thank you,     If I also mourn the ecosystems,     You drained, dried, dug, destroyed?     I appreciate your teachings,     And I will dance alone,     And I will not dance alone.
