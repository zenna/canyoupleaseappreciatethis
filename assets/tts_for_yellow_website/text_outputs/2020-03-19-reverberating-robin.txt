Reverberating Robin, by Emily Mackevicius, March 19, 2020: Before our group's video meeting, Dmitriy told me to check my mail. I washed my hands thoroughly, and went downstairs to find Beard Papa's cream puffs for my birthday, in a yellow box to match this page, as well as another envelope I'd open later. I washed my hands again and joined the meeting.  When the jack-hammering from my neighboring construction disrupted us, Larry said he'd be hearing his own neighboring jackhammers soon, and I took my headphone across the street to the park, where I knew the trees were flowering. Dmitriy, who lives across from the same park, recognized the robin through his speakers.  He sings at 4am every day!!  He's back this year, started singing three days ago!!  We continued brainstorming with Ching about tweaks and wide-reaching applications of the model she is building. I was already considering telling you about that robin when I was fumbling to open the envelope I picked up earlier. A birthday 'lovepop' popup card from Joseph unfolded into an intricate paper robin perched on a flowering paper branch.
