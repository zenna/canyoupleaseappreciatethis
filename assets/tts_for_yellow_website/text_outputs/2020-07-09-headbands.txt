Headbands, by Emily Mackevicius, July 09, 2020: I thought I would see a slackline in the park, but I had to leave before it materialized.       I left with a postcard from Craig Schley still in my hand, after signing his petition to be on the ballot.       Neighbors lined benches, fences, and front steps.  How did they see me?  A white lady rushing by with a Craig Schley postcard?      I paused, sensing one woman had something to say.  "I see myself in you," she said. I felt honored. I nodded and commented that we both were wearing headbands.  I was proud of my headband, having woven it myself.  She acknowledged our similar appearances (which was generous because on the surface we do not look alike, and I realized I had sloppily hitched up my pant legs in the heat).        But she said that she saw something else.  Deeper? Beyond appearances? I forget what words she used. But when she saw I got her message she said "God bless you," and started to move on, and I pressed my hands together and said, "you too." I felt like she was joyfully gazing through my eyes as I bounded up the steps home.
