Salty Resting, by Emily Mackevicius, July 23, 2023: Eating flaky sea salt straight from the bag . . .     I got rid of my purple plant, kept only a cutting,     Appreciate each hair on its leaves,                     for what?                 I cling to this dusty sun lit leaf hair, this moment,     To escape the racing turbulence of possible     moments,                     planning, cleaning, doing, sharing, waiting, checking, . . .                 I appreciate more leaf hairs, taste more salt,     Because you agreed to appreciate this, so     Thanks for carrying me,                     as I rest here.                 I wish I shared every leaf hair, and since I canâ€™t,     I wish unshared appreciations could taste like shared ones.     Do you also fear the turbulence                     that marks the end of                                     a moment                                    a poem                                    appreciation ?
