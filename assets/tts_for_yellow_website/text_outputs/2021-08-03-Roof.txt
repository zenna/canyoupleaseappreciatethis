Roof, by Emily Mackevicius, August 03, 2021: My roof opened today, and is remarkably beautiful. The neighbors spread out on fancy deck furniture among the roses, avoiding eye contact. Maybe we can watch the parks (Central and Morningside) change with the seasons.  The doorman made us leave at 9pm. Joe suggested I do yoga there, but I may have stayed up too late for tomorrow morning again.
