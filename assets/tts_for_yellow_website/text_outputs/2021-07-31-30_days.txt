30 days, by Emily Mackevicius, July 31, 2021: When we lived together, Kory, who used to go by Katya, would commit to practice something every day for a month.  30 days drawing, 30 days poi spinning, 30 days singing. I was inspired by the logic -- 30 days strikes a compromise between once or twice and forever.       Please appreciate that I saw Kory today, who took a spontaneous detour to Bahn Vietnamese food on Amsterdam Avenue on their way from Massachusetts to Tennessee to Oregon in their yellow car, and even lingered for good conversation and bubble tea.      Please also appreciate how Joseph re-did the first couple days of Yoga-with-Kassandra's 30 day yoga challenge last month, so I could do it with him, and how he encouraged 30 days of appreciation writing when the idea popped up as obviously a Good Idea, but in need of encouragement.
