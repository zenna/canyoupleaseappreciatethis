String of Energy, by Sophia Burress, March 09, 2020: Recently I discovered that training my mind is like training a dog to walk on a leash. At first, it felt so constricting to keep my mind from thinking. That’s what it was built to do! Who am I to stop it? That’s also how I felt when I put my dog [Zadie] on a leash. But she’s built to run! She can’t be contained! Then I realized, there is a bigger “I” with a better plan than the one my mind has. And just like the leash keeps Zadie safe, now I have a leash for my monkey mind. At first it was purple and sort of plasticky. But that was harsh on my hands. So, I switched it out for a well-worn red rope. That felt better, but it was heavy. Now the leash is a string of energy. Over the years, Zadie has learned the confines of the sidewalk. Perhaps one day I will be able to retire my string of energy.
