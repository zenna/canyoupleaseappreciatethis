Incessant Thoughts, by Emily Mackevicius, July 24, 2023: Incessant thoughts of change,     The windswept precipice,     Is not a place for rest.     Love fragile rugged vertigo,         Appreciate rest.                 Is rest the radical change,     I'm seeking? Yes and also No.     Appreciate my Saturday, 9:45am     Barbie movie alone,         train to Rockaway,                 Sleeping and reading in the hot sand,     Umbrella, towel, cool drinks, clementine,     Radically rested, Appreciate     Sunday, sweet Joe morning,         Joyfully coding up                 Yellow Herbert to recite my poetry,     Until cello quintet, such joy,     Enough energy to cook and clean.      Appreciate this is still         not everything.
