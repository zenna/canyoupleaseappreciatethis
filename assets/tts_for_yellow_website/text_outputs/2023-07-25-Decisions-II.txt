Decisions II, by Emily Mackevicius, July 25, 2023: Do you remember what it feels like         to have decided but not officially decided?     Someone may have heard your decision,         before you admitted it to yourself.     Some colleagues may still not hear it.         After you've been clear enough,     Often enough, they still ask why,         or disagree. You've been patient,     Listened for hours, weeks, months.     You still respect and cherish those         Who still don't hear you.     But now you've officially decided,         It's easier to communicate your decision.     The tingling pressure of waiting         For everyone to understand and agree     Pops. Ouch. Relief.                 Appreciate that Gily recognized this feeling in me today, over Whatsapp on the roof.                 Appreciate that I recognized this feeling in Zenna today, as I listened, happily interrupting less than I might have.                 Appreciate that when I asked Zenna to close our conversation with a recitation by Yellow Herbert, Herbert randomly chose Decisions by Lullyn Tavares.                 Appreciate Zenna's 'Thanks Mum!'
