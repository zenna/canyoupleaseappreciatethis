Intergenerational Circling, by Emily Mackevicius, August 07, 2023: I knew that hiking with my mother                   Would be beautiful,                    Again.    Appreciate that it was.    My almost flooded socks and sandles,    Her injured tendon and hiking poles,    Intergenerational craft circles,    As legit as it gets,    Inspiring each other,                    Imperfectly.    I turned away to let tears                   Flow in the mossy forest --    Fullness, satisfaction.    Until it could be better.    The world could be better.    We could be better.    Appreciate the                    Fullness                   Of not enough.
